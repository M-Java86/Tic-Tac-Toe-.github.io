# Grading

Currently we use [Google classroom][] for grading. See their official
documentation for how to get setup (_Note you will need to use a personal gmail
account when creating a new classroom. Otherwise students will not  be able to
join a classroom created under the @generalassemb.ly domain_)

# Submission

* Completed student work should be uploaded/pushed to a public git repo
  (through the General Assembly's git enterprise or Github).
* A link to that github repository should then be submitted. 

## Daily Grading

* Grading is done under a pass/fail policy.
* Scores between 1 - 99 should not be given. 
* 0 is a failing grade
* 100 is a passing grade

## Resubmissions

Resubmission qualifications for a student's work should be left to an
instructor. There is no official policy on when a student can resubmit
work.

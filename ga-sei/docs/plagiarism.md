## Plagiarism Review

### Statement

General Assembly takes academic honesty very seriously, and as such will not tolerate any student who plagiarizes in order to satisfy class requirements.  Programs at General Assembly are intensive, require a lot of work on the part of the student, and students will occasionally not be able to complete work in a timely fashion.

Rather than rely on work that’s not your own to create the appearance of success, let your instructional team know as early as possible that you are not prepared for the work.  It is much easier to come up with a plan, than it is to succeed if you’ve been removed from the program.

### Definition

Plagiarism is the act of claiming that work that does not belong to you is in fact your own.  It can take many forms, and each concentration at General Assembly will have a slightly different guideline to identify plagiarism in their field.

Generally it is safe to assume that if you are including work that does not belong to you in an effort to build on your own work — cite it.  If you are using work that does not belong to you as a replacement for your own work, you’re probably plagiarizing.

Plagiarism can unintentionally occur.  While it is fine to use outside sources, if **all** or **most** of your code (specifically logic/JS/Ruby) is from other git repos/videos/blog posts, you are in violation of the plagiarism rules cited above.  If you do use outside resources, make sure you **cite** those resources in your README.md file.

### Procedure

If an instructor is in doubt of a students work or has evidence of plagiarism, the student will be asked to justify the work they've submitted. This often is in the context of making you explain your code line by line. Should they be unable to show the work they have claimed as their own is in fact theirs, the student will face disciplinary action.

Instances of plagiarism will be evaluated on a case by case basis, but will most likely result in removal from the program

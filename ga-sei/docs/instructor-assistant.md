* Make sure to communicate to the students (through channels presented in the
  [communication guides][]) that are marked as anything other than present.

#### Grading

* Start grading after attendance is taken
* See the [grading documentation][] for details on how to

* If a student has any questions about grades have them talk to the lead
  instructor. _No corrections or regarding should be done without the 
  foreknowledge of the lead-instructor as they are responsible for the

* If there are multiple IAs for a single session then communicate through the
  planning slack channel who is taking attendance and who is grading. Once the
  person taking attendence is finished that person should help grade homework.

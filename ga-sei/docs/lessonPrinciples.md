# Lesson Principles

# Purpose 

__Provides a "what to update" for when a lesson is updated.__

This has 3 side effects: 

1. Makes instruction team prep time more efficient and therefore valuable
1. Provides a measurement when evaluating changes.
1. Keeps instruction team unified on our delivery

# Global Principles

The following principles should be held with respect to lesson objectives,
content, and naming:

1. Axiomatic 
1. Semantic
1. Succinct

# Lesson Objectives

Lesson Objectives should:

1. be atomic (as small as possible and no smaller)
1. abstract enough to be re-usable
1. concrete enough to be demonstrable
1. be concept focused.

From this the following corollaries follow.

Lesson objectives should:

1. Be the _roadmap_ and the _source of truth_ for all lesson content.  
1. Act as a basis for CFUs (check for understandings)
1. Be loosely framework/library/language independent. 

Lesson objectives should not:

1. be composed of other lesson objectives.
1. Contain ambiguous language (such as "Discuss ...") 

# Lesson Content

Lesson content should:

1. expound on the lesson objectives, no more, no less.
1. have zero external dependencies.
1. contain multiple, small, quick, CFUs

From this the following corollaries follow.

Lesson content should:

1. Be as minimal as possible to teach the content
1. Be easy to maintain

# Lesson Naming

The names of lessons should be: 

1. semantic
1. simple
1. transparent with respect to the lesson content.

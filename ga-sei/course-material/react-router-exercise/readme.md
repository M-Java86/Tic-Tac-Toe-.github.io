# Lab: React Router & APIs

For today's lab you will be building a stock tracking app. The lab will be broken down into two parts...
  1. Build a React app that uses `react-router`
  2. Communicate with 3rd-party APIs

## Part I: [React Router](part-i.md)

If you want to see what a finished version of Part I might look like, see the [Part 1 solution code]

## Part II: [Adding APIs](part-ii.md)

If you want to see what a finished version of Part II might look like, see the [Part 2 solution code]

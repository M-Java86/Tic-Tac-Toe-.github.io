### Overview

For your 4th project, you'll have the choice of building a MERN stack app or a
Django + React app. Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want
for this app. This project will be solo.

You'll need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your
instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember
to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals â€“ scope
creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and
identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP (Minimum Viable
Product) ahead of schedule, you can decide which reach goals to focus on for the
remainder of your time.

### How to Get Started
* First design your _MVP_ (Minimum Viable Product). Have a plan for completing
  an MVP before getting too involved with _advanced_ features.
* Use _Trello_ to prioritize your User Stories / features. Focus on what is
  most important / critical to success.
* _Timebox_ any experimental or optional ideas, features, or technologies.
  Remember that good _time management_ is key!
* Commit your code early and often with good commit messages.
* Use Git Branching for experimenting with different ideas and technologies.

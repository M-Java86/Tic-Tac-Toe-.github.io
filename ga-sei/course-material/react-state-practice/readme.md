## This task requires you to:

 Add a shopping cart to our Hardware Store.

Create a CartView component that displays all of the items in our cart.

Within ShopView, add a Add to Cart button that will add an item to the shopping cart

For each Product in our cart, show a button that allows us to remove the product from the cart.

BONUS: If an item already exists in the cart, add a "quantity" display and increment it when "Add To Cart" is clicked again.

Your end result should look something like this. https://i.imgur.com/XjX70FQ.png

# css-mediaQueries-exercise


Now after looking at some media queries letâ€™s make one of our own. If you open this exercise you will see the cat_responsive folder which has a built website, but no media queries!

Let's add a media query where if the screen is under 700px:

1. The font size of "Adopt Cats with Us!" is smaller, maybe half the size.
2. The images display stacked in a single column.
3. The cats for adoption images have some padding or margin to the left so they are not on the left border but more toward the middle of their div.


There are some images:
- layoutDesktop1
- layoutDesktop2
- layoutMedia1
- layoutMedia2

If you look at those images you can see the media queries goal.

Remember you can use your dev tools to inspect elements.

# Object-Oriented Programming in Javascript

## Learning Objectives

- Answer the question, what is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- Identify and define: a class, an instance, a constructor and inheritance
- Use the `new` keyword to create instances of a class
- Create a class that inherits from another using the `extends` and `super`
  keywords

## Overview

This day-long workshop on Object Oriented Programming and Object Oriented
JavaScript is broken up in to 3 sections followed by a mini-lab.

The first section covers Object Oriented Programming generally and at a high
level. This will be one of the few times during SEI where we "lecture". For the
first hour and a half of today's lesson, we'll present the basics of object
oriented programming as they apply across object-oriented programming languages.
We'll then dive into the JavaScript syntax of OOP in the second section - how we
define a class, how we create attributes, how we extend classes - all things
that will make sense after the first section of the class.

After we break for lunch, we'll continue discussing OOP in JavaScript but it'll
be more practical: we'll define and work with classes together and you'll
complete a couple of short exercises, all as part of section three of this
workshop. We'll finish off the workshop with a mini-lab where you will take what
you've learned about OOP and go build something.

Why is this workshop structured this way? The principles of OOP that we're going
to discuss apply generally across languages, not just JavaScript. So it'll be
important to understand them when we go to learn our second object oriented
programming language: Python. It's also important to understand OOP at a high
level and separate from a particular language. At the end of the day, OOP is a
*paradigm*: it's a way of thinking about software development.

# Divide-and-Conquer Sorts Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on [Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/882?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f) before attempting the in-class exercises.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note
The myGA module contains links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWpQW). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.** 

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms is a **Tier 1** lesson. Students should understand how merge sort and quick sort work even if they aren't able to fully implement the algorithms (they're complex!).

## Teaching Tips
* If students are struggling, focus them on the [merge sort](https://git.generalassemb.ly/software-engineering-immersive/SEI-Course-Materials/blob/master/6_computer-science-materials/algorithms/divide-and-conquer-sorts/exercises/MergeSort.js) algorithm before moving on to the quick sort algorithm. This exercise has code for the merge helper function, so students are really only solving the first part of the algorithm.
* The merge sort exercise contains the solution code for the merge helper function; for more advanced students, feel free to remove this so that students have to implement that, too.

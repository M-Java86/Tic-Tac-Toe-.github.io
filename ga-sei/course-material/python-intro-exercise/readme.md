# Python Koans

Koans are short exercises that build off of each other. Finish an exercise by
getting the test to pass. With each passing test, you will achieve a higher
level of Python enlightenment. üßò‚Äç

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone the
   [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) repository
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

You'll be working through the koans provided in the
[Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) repository. Fork and
clone that repository (not this one).

**READ THE DIRECTIONS** in that repository for instructions on how to make the
koans pass. These koans are basically incomplete tests that you need to fill in
with the right value to make pass.

Work through the koans in the `python3/` directory only. Commit and push your
code as you go! You should have one commit per section. When you finish the
required sections, push your commits to GitHub and create an issue on this
repository with a link to your forked Python Koans.

**This step is very important:** there is a `koans.txt` file inside the
`python3/` directory. Update that file so it only lists the koans that are
assigned below!

To run the koans:

- `cd` into the `python3` directory
- Run the command `python3 contemplate_koans.py`

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

[Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) has 37 sections,
please complete the following:

1. `koans.about_asserts.AboutAsserts`

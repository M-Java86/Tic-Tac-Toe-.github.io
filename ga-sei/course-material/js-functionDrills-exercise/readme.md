# Homework : Function Drilling

## Setup

This exercise features automated tests that will let you know if your code is working or not.

To set this up, navigate into the `function-drills-exercises` directory in your terminal.  Once you are there,  run `npm install` -- this will download any assignment-specific JavaScript
dependencies into to a directory called `node_modules`. Don't worry about understanding what's happening here just yet.
We will cover what this command means a bit later in the class.  See `Testing Your Work` below for instructions on
how to run the automated tests.

As you work through this assignment, you should make commits regularly.
Since there are automated tests built into this assignment, we
recommend that you make a commit every time that you pass a new test, in
addition to any other time you feel might be appropriate (e.g. just before
trying out something new).

## Instructions

Read through `hw.js` and complete all of the functions listed there.

### Testing Your Work

A set of automated tests, written in the [Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/)
testing framework, has been provided for you with this assignment.
To run these tests, type `npm test` into the console from the root directory
of this repo. Test your work regularly, and read the feedback from the tests
carefully -- it may give you a clue about what to do next.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to submit your work,

1. Run the command `npm test` and take a screenshot of the output in your
    terminal.
2. Push your code to Genereal Assembly Github
3. Submit the link to your repo 

The submission should include a comment with a 'comfort' score.  This is a rating
on how you feel about the material, from 1 (very uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)

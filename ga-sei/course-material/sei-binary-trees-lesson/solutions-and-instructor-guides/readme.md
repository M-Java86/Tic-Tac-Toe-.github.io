# Binary Trees and Tries Instructor Guide

This lesson has a couple of moving parts to it! It starts to get tricky here, so let's break it down.

**Part 1**
* myGA module: [Binary Trees and Tries](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/8?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=efcbcfa0-d5eb-4f2b-912b-dae58e6434d9)
* Exercise: [Implementing a Binary Tree](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ed-product-library/SEI-Course-Materials/blob/master/6_computer-science-materials/data-structures/binary-trees-and-tries/exercises/binaryTree.js)

**Part 2**
* myGA module: [Balancing Binary Trees](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/263?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=efcbcfa0-d5eb-4f2b-912b-dae58e6434d9)
* Exercise: [Implementing an AVL Tree](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ed-product-library/SEI-Course-Materials/blob/master/6_computer-science-materials/data-structures/binary-trees-and-tries/exercises/AVLTree.js)

### Important Note
Both myGA modules contain links to starter code in CodePen: [Binary Trees](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/jJOxBd) and [AVL Trees](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/bZGMaQ). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.**

The CodePens are there to give students a chance to review the exercises and attempt them themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Overall, the topic is a **Tier 2** lesson. Students should complete both myGA modules so that they understand the concepts and attempt the exercises (which are tricky!). Think about the material this way: **myGA modules are Tier 2**, while the **exercises are more like Tier 3**.

## Teaching Tips
Because there are several components to this lesson, here's how we recommend structuring this content:
1. Students should complete both myGA modules.
2. In class, start with the [Implementing a Binary Tree](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ed-product-library/SEI-Course-Materials/blob/master/6_computer-science-materials/data-structures/binary-trees-and-tries/exercises/binaryTree.js) exercise. The `height()` and `isBalanced()` functions are more advanced, so focus students on completing the first few functions in the exercise first.
3. If students are able to complete that, move to the [Implementing an AVL Tree](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ed-product-library/SEI-Course-Materials/blob/master/6_computer-science-materials/data-structures/binary-trees-and-tries/exercises/AVLTree.js) exercise.

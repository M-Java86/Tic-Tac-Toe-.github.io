# Hogwarts

OH NO!! He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has placed a curse on the source code of
Hogwarts' administration software. Errors, typos, and bugs abound! Literally
nothing works.

## Prerequisites

* Python
* Django models, migrations, views and templates
* Virtual environments

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install dependencies.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

You are Pythonista Hermoine, a member of Dumbledore's Army. Correct all the errors so that this app runs properly.

> The errors are all in locations that we've covered in class. (Even Voldemort's
> not that heartless!)

> Looking at files in VSCode with syntax highlighting may be helpful.

> Read the error messages and start googling!

## Bonus

Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (creating a new student).
Include a "Sorting Hat" method to randomly assign new students to one of
Hogwarts' four houses.

Where do you think this logic should go?

## Project Week

### Attendance, expectations of time commitment
Students are required to be in class working on their project during regular class hours. You are encouraged to continue working on your projects into the evenings on- and off-campus.

### Standups
We encourage you to hold your stand-ups in the mornings when you start working to help you all keep each other accountable and help each other out. When you start working each day, reach out on Slack and see if anyone is around to hold a standup!

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

### Where to find help
1. Seek out help online

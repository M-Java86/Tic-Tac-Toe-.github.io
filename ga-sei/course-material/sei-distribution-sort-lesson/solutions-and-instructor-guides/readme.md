# Distribution Sorts Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on [Distribution Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/802?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f) before attempting the in-class exercises.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note
The myGA module contains links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/RdwpEJ). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.** 

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Distribution Sorts is a **Tier 3** lesson (the first non-Tier 1 Algorithms lesson)! Bucket sort is a less common interview topic and a less popular sorting algorithm than the ones covered earlier.

### Teaching Tips
**Do:**
* Ensure that students still complete the myGA module so that they know conceptually about bucket sort and radix sort.
* Make the [CodePen exercise](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/RdwpEJ) at the end optional if you're low on time.
* If students are struggling with any of the other sorting algorithms, take the time to review any of those implementations (bubble, insertion, merge, or quick sort) and skip the bucket sort implementation exercise.
* If you have more advanced students, encourage them to try the bucket sort implementation on their own.
* Come back to this lesson later in the course if you happen to have extra time.

**Don't:**
* Tell students about the tiering; it's not really relevant to them, but more a guideline for you, the instructor, to prioritize the material. We don't want to make them think that this topic is unimportant or irrelevant.
* Completely ignore this topic; it's still important for students to know what bucket sort is, even if you don't spend a ton of time in class on it.

# Graphs Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on Graphs before attempting the in-class Exercises.

The exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder also contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note

The myGA module contains links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/JzjvvE). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.**

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Graphs is a **Tier 2** lesson. They're an important data structure, but can become complex quickly. Try to have students successfully complete the implementation in the exercise file, but don't worry too much if they struggle with it. 

## Teaching Tips
* If students are having trouble with the graph implementation, it's more important that they understand graphs conceptually, directed and undirected graphs, and search methods for graphs.

# Getting PGSQL

- Mac: http://postgresapp.com/
  - Download
  - Move it to `/Applications`
  - We want to use it from the command line, so we add it to the search path.
    - `$ atom ~/.bash_profile`
    - Add this line:
   `export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin`
   - save and close.
   - Update your terminal.
  - Then open the app and click "Open psql"
- Linux
  - `apt-get install postgresql-9.4`
- All
  - Verify your installation, by running `psql` in your terminal.  You should see:

```
$ psql
psql (9.4.4)
Type "help" for help.

zakk=#
```  

### Common Mistake

If you see this when your run `psql`, you have not started the PostgresApp first.

```
$ psql
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```

## Where's all this data stored, anyway?

- Look in PostgresApp preferences.  You should see `~/Library/Application\ Support/Postgres/var-9.4`.  Let's take a look in there.
- We see `postgres-server.log`
- Check out a file within `global/`. What is THAT?
  - This is binary (not text) data, spread out across multiple files

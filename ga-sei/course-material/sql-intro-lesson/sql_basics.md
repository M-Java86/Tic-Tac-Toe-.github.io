# Databases

## Learning Objectives

#### Concepts

- Explain what a database is and why you would use one
- Explain how a database, a database management system (DBMS) and SQL relate to one another
- Describe a database schema and how it relates to tables, rows and columns

#### Mechanics

- Create a new PostgreSQL database
- Set up a PostgreSQL database schema with a saved SQL file
- Seed a PostgreSQL database with a saved SQL file
- Execute basic SQL commands to execute CRUD actions in a database

## Framing

What's the main problem with our programs right now in terms of user
experience?

When we quit them, any data / progress is lost! Right now, we can only store
information in memory, which is wiped when we quit out of a program. We
need a way to fix this.

Enter databases...

## Databases (5 minutes / 1:00)

A database is a tool for storing data. There are many ways to store data on a computer (e.g., writing to a text file, a binary file). Databases, however, offer a number of advantages...

**Permanence**: Once we write data to our database, we can be pretty sure it
won't be lost (unless the server catches on fire).

**Speed**: Databases are generally optimized to be fast at retrieving and updating information. Literally, DBs can be 100,000x faster than reading from a file.

**Consistency**: Databases can enforce rules regarding consistency of data, especially when handling simultaneous requests to update information.

**Scalability**: Databases can handle lots of requests per second, and many DBs have ways to scale to massive loads by replicating / syncing information across multiple DBs.

**Querying**: DBs make it easy to search, sort, filter and combine related data using a **Query Language**.

> Note: There's an acronym in computer science [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID), which is a set of properties that ensure data is reliably stored. You can read the wiki article for more info but, in short, a lot of the properties mentioned above make a database ACID-compliant.

## What's a Relational Database? (10 minutes / 1:10)

The most popular type of database is a **relational** database. How do they work?

**Data is stored in tables.**
- These tables are organized by columns and rows, much like a spreadsheet
- Tables are named according to what they model (e.g., `artists`, `songs`)
- In the case of `artists`, each row represents one artist
- Each column is called an **attribute** or **field**, such as `id`, `title` or `birth_year`

**Communicate via SQL (Structured Query Language)**
- SQL is a database language used specifically for relational databases
- This is in contrast to non-relational databases, which we will use later in the course

**Can relate data between tables**
- Hence the name *relational* database
- We can relate rows in the `songs` table to rows in the `artists` table
- We use a `key` to do this, which is a field that is unique for each row in a table
- The key is often represented using an `id`, which is a unique identifier for each entry in a table

### Types of Relational Databases

There are lots of relational databases, such as **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL** and **SQLite**. They are all similar in that they use SQL, but they do have different features.

MySQL claims to be "the most popular open-source database," while PostgreSQL claims in response to be "the most advanced open-source database". It's true that in most tests, Postgres comes out ahead in terms of speed and has many features MySQL lacks, such as true full-text search and handling geo-data.

### Terminology

While this is a bit technical, it's worth clarifying some terminology...

* **Database**: The actual set of data being stored. We may create multiple databases on our computer, usually one for each application.
* **Database Language**: The language used to interact with a database. With relational databases, that is SQL.
* **Database Management System**: The software that lets a user interact (query) the data in a database. Examples are PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
* **Database CLI**: A tool offered by most DBMSs that allows us to query the database from the command line. For PostgreSQL, we'll use `psql`.

## Exploring Postgres (15 minutes / 1:25)

We are learning in order to be able to read it. We'll look stuff up when we want to write it.

But there have been times GA grads need to use it!

![SQL](./images/screenshot_kibble.png)

Start by "spotlight searching" (`command-space`) for Postgres and launching `Postgres.app`. Once you see the elephant in your Mac menu bar, you'll know Postgres is running.

### psql commands

We'll use `psql` as our primary means of interacting with our databases. Later on we'll use Ruby or server-side Javascript to do so in our programs.

Here's a quick demo. I recommend just watching and taking notes for this part. Don't try to code along.

```sql
help -- general help
\?   -- help with psql commands
\h   -- help with SQL commands
\l   -- Lists all databases

CREATE DATABASE generalassembly; -- Don't forget the semicolon!
\l -- What changed?

\c generalassembly -- Connect to generalassembly database

\d -- Lists all tables

CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  quote TEXT,
  birthday VARCHAR,
  ssn INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
); -- Here we are defining a schema. More on this in just a bit...

\d

SELECT * FROM students;

INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Andy', 'Whitely');
-- This won't work!

INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, quote, birthday, ssn) VALUES ('Andy', 'Whitely', 'Two goldfish are in a tank. One says, "Know how to drive this thing?"', 'April 7', 8675309);
SELECT * FROM students;

UPDATE students SET first_name = 'Andrew' WHERE first_name = 'Andy';
SELECT * FROM students;

DELETE FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Andy';
DELETE FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Andrew';

SELECT * FROM students;

DROP TABLE students; -- "drop" means to delete an entire table or database

DROP DATABASE wdi15;

\q --quits
```

In short...
- Backslash commands (e.g. `\l` ) are commands to navigate psql. These are psql-specific.
- Everything else is SQL. The SQL is what actually interacts with the database.

> If you're curious as to where exactly your databases are being stored locally, enter `SHOW data_directory;` while in psql.

### SQL Syntax

- All statements end in a semicolon
- Whitespace doesn't matter
- Uppercasing
- Always use single quotes when typing out string values
- [Ye olde style guide](http://leshazlewood.com/software-engineering/sql-style-guide/)

## Schema (10 minutes / 1:35)

Every application's database will have one or more tables. You will recall, each table stores information about a particular model (e.g., `artists`, `songs`).

Each table has a **schema**, which defines what columns it has. For each column the schema defines...
- The column's name
- the column's data type
- Any constraints for that column

### Common Data Types

Here are some common data types for SQL databases. They are all, for the most part, things you've seen before...

- Boolean
- Integer
- Float
- Text / VARCHAR
  - VARCHAR is short, TEXT is long
- NULL
- Date
- Time

> [And many more...](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/datatype.html)

### Constraints

Constraints act as limits on the data that can go in a column.
- e.g., `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`

> [And many more...](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/ddl-constraints.html)

### Defining a Schema

Next we're going to build a schema for a database in a sample application. It can change later on if we need to add / remove tables or columns, but we'll start with something simple.

Instead of typing this into `psql`, we're going to do so by saving the schema to a `.sql` file and run it, just like we have with `.js` and `.rb` files.

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack server
application.** You will be **building a Node/Express App with Mongo/Mongoose,**
which means that you will learn about what it takes to build a functional
application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It is a lot, but we have given you the tools over the
last few weeks to build what you need; you get to be creative in choosing what
sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you will be
designing the app yourself. We hope you will exercise creativity on this
project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to
define what your users will want to do with the app.

### How to Get Started
* First design your _MVP_ (Minimum Viable Product). Have a plan for completing
  an MVP before getting too involved with _advanced_ features.
* Use Project board (Trello / Github Issues and projects) to prioritize your
  User Stories / features. Focus on what is most important / critical to
  success.

### How To Submit
* Submit your project github (your public github) link by the time indicated by your instructor.

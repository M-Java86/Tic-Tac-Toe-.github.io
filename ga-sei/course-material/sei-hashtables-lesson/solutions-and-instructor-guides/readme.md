# Hash Tables Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the two myGA modules on Hash Tables before attempting the in-class exercises:
* Introduction to Hash Tables: Reviews hash tables conceptually.
* Hash Tables Deep Dive: Dives into the specifics and technicalities of hash tables.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder also contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note
The second myGA module, Hash Tables Deep Dive, links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWQVm). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.**

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Hash Tables is a **Tier 2** lesson. Both myGA modules are important to students fully understanding the concepts of hash tables and hash functions. The first module explores hash tables in an extended analogy; the second module goes into the technicalities and specifics. 

Make sure students understand the concepts and vocabulary related to hash tables; both modules work in tandem to achieve this.

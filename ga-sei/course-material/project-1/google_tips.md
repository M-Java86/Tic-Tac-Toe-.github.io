## How to use Google to find solutions

When you are stuck on a code problem and the relevant docs don’t provide a solution, then your first port of call should be to perform a Google search. You can guarantee that MANY others before you have been stuck on exactly the same problem, so it’s highly likely that there is a solution out there to your question. In general, it’s good practice just to type in the keywords of your question or request. But before you start typing into the Google search bar, you first need to prepare exactly what you want the input to be. 

### Questions to ask yourself before searching

* __Spelling?__ Make sure that you are spelling your words correctly, especially when it comes to code languages or frameworks. Google is usually good at detecting spelling errors, but you will get better results by using the correct spelling.
* __Language?__ Rather than just typing the question into Google, make sure that you attach the relevant language at the beginning or the end of your input. For example, “how to make text bold _css_”, or “_javascript_ capitalize first letter of strings in array”. This will help you to get better results because there are many programming languages that may have similar search questions.
* __Framework?__ Like with language, make sure that you attach the relevant framework to your search criteria for better results. For example, “using google fonts in _react_”, or “_ruby_ on rails how to connect an api”. Also, be aware that there are sometimes multiple versions of the same framework, like with React - _React_ or _React.js_, _React Native_, and _React Redux_.
* __Accuracy?__ Google will usually give you results loosely based on your input, by matching keywords. However, if you want your search to precisely match what you are looking for, then simply put quotes (“ ”) around what pieces of information you want to match verbatim.
* __Images?__ Sometimes, you will be looking for a relevant image to use in your project. You probably already know that Google has an “images" tab that specifically searches for images. However, to be more precise you can also click the “tools” option to refine your search by size, color, type (e.g. face, photo, clip art or line drawing), standard view, etc. Also, if you are wanting to just grab an image to link to your project, just hover over the image, use a two-finger click, and select “copy image address” to add the image URL to your clipboard.

### Things to consider

Now that you have a better idea of how to optimize your search, it’s important to know how to best sift through the results. Make sure that you read both the headline and content of each search result item, to make sure that it is relevant.

You will probably notice that Stack Overflow shows up in a lot of your search results. Stack Overflow is an extremely useful online community developer site, where coders share their knowledge with each other. While this may be a great place to find the answers to your questions, it’s important to note that not all of the advice is going to be good advice. However, Stack Overflow has an upvote/downvote system that usually helps push the better responses to the top of the list. Also, each response will have comments that other coders have in turn responded with, so you can probably get a good idea of what works well and what doesn’t.

Good luck!

# Practice with OOP

## JS Classes Review

### Whiteboard (10 min / 0:10)

With your neighbor or the people in your row, grab a marker from the instructor
and find some space in the room on the whiteboard walls or on your desks. With
your neighbor or row, pick one of the following specs for a class and write the
code on your whiteboard to define it:

#### A Player
(Like from a sports team)

- `name` attribute
- `height` attribute
- `run` method

#### A Movie

- `title` attribute
- `length` attribute
- `play` method

#### A Building

- `type` attribute (commercial, residential)
- `squareFeet` attribute
- `addTenant` method

### You Do: [Make an ATM Class](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/es6-classes-practice) (20 min / 0:40)

> 15 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

## Inheritance Review (10 min / 0:50)

### Whiteboard Continued (10 min / 0:00)

With the same group that you were working with before, return to your whiteboard
class definition. Extend your classes with two sub classes. Come up with your
own properties and attributes as a group! Are there some you want to add to the
parent class?

#### A Player

- A `SoccerPlayer` class
- A `BasketballPlayer` class

#### A Movie

- An `ActionAdventureMovie` class
- A `RomanceMovie` class

#### A Building

- An `ApartmentBuilding` class
- An `OfficeBuilding` class

### You Do: [Inheritance](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/es6-classes-inheritance-practice) (20 minutes / 1:10)

> 15 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

## Break (10 min / 1:20)

## You Do: [Gladiator](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/js-gladiator) (1:10  / 2:30)

Gladiator is a mini-lab. The instructor will be at the instructor's table to
answer any questions. Fork the repository and make a pull request to submit what
you have at the end of class.

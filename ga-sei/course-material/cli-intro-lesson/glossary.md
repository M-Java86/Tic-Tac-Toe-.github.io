# Some TERMinology

* **Terminal** - the application that presents a command line interface to the user.

* **Shell** - a command line interpreter that executes the commands that the user types. Common shells are sh, bsh, csh, ksh, bash, fish, and zsh (we will be using bash in this class)

* **Process** - a program that is currently running on the computer

* **Application** - a program that consists of one or more processes

* **Prompt** — is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line
   interface to indicate readiness to accept commands. Its intent is to
   literally prompt the user to take action. A prompt usually ends with one of
   the characters `$`, `%`, `#`, `:`, `>` and often includes other information,
   such as the path of the current working directory.

* **Arguments(Parameters)** — are items of information provided to a program or
   command when it is started. A program can have many command-line arguments
   that identify sources or destinations of information, or that alter the
   operation of the program.

* **Flags(Options)** — modify the operation of a command; the effect is
   determined by the command's program. Options follow the command name on the
   command line, separated by spaces.

* **Path** - is the description that tells us (or a computer) where a file or
   folder is on our computer.

# Stacks and Queues Instructor Guide
Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on Stacks and Queues before attempting the in-class exercises.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder also contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

## Tiering
Stacks and Queues is a **Tier 2** lesson. However, stacks and queues are referenced in later CS lessons and are a hot topic for interviews. Here's our thinking:
* Assign the myGA module and make sure that students understand the data structures conceptually.
* If the bracket matching game is challenging for students, it's OK to skip it or leave it incomplete. It's more important to understand stacks and queues as concepts and know the basics of their implementation.

## Teaching Tips
* The myGA lesson contains the code for how stacks and queues are implemented. It does _not_ contain a link to the bracket matching challenge on CodePen. This exercise is **in-class only**.
* If you don't have time for bracket matching, at least take some time to review stack and queue implementations and basic methods (`push`, `pop`, etc.).

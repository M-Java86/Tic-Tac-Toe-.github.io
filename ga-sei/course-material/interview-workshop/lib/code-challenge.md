# Code Challenge

One of the most common aspects of your job search will be code challenges - some
technical problem that the company will send you to solve. Most of the time,
these code challenges will be for you to solve on your own, in your own time.
However, sometimes a company will ask you to come in and solve them in person.
We're going to practice solving problems in front of an audience.

## Instructions

You will need a projector or some way of showing your screen to the audience.
Each group member will take turns being the candidate (the one solving the code
challenge) and the interviewers (the ones watching). If you are the candidate,
connect to the projector and open your code challenge. Work until you finish or
for 20 minutes.

If you are the candidate, you want to solve the challenge but you also want to
walk through how you approach the problem and what you're thinking about. It's
important to keep talking as you work through the problem!

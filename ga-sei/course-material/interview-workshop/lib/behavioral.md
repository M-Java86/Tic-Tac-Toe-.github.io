# Behavioral

Behavioral interview questions are a great way to break the ice during an
interview. The questions will be pretty general and a way for the interviewer to
learn a little bit about you as a candidate.

That said, they are not questions you want to take lightly! Think of them as
easy points. With a little practice, you will be able to come up with a great
answer on the spot.

## Instructions

Work through the list of questions below, one by one. Spend around 20 minutes
reading through the questions and jotting down notes for what you want to say in
your answer to each question. This should be done as a team! Work together,
trade ideas, and help each other refine what you want to say.

Once you have some notes for each question, it's interview time! Each group
member will take turns being the candidate (the one answering questions) and the
interviewers (the ones asking the questions). If you are the candidate, sit on
one side of the table, across from the interviewers. Interviewers should take
turns asking a question from the list below. Don't ask questions in order,
instead ask a random question from the list.

When you are the candidate, use your phone to record the audio of your answer to
each question. Play the audio of your answer back and take notes on how you
sound. Then have the interviewers ask you the same question again!

# Back end

The questions you'll answer here span across all parts of the back end. Some of
them are trivia, others are short-answer.

## Instructions

Each group member will take turns being the candidate (the one answering
questions) and the interviewers. When it is your turn to be the candidate, sit
on the opposite side of the table as the interviewers.

Interviewers should randomly pick questions from the list to ask the candidate.
The candidate should offer their best answer without looking at the answer! It's
really, really important to answer the question as best you can, even if you
have no idea what they're asking.

If you get a question that you don't know the answer to:

* Ask follow up questions
* Start explaining what you do know. 

If you get a question that you don't know the answer to, that's okay. First, try
asking follow up questions. Then say you don't know or you're not sure and
explain what you do know (literally, "I don't know the answer to that but I can
tell you ...").

## Before beginning exercises

Rotating is challenging with a large cohort. Using random team script saves a lot of time and although we'll have some developers pair more than once, such is random.

To prevent this use the random script.
Setting up the teams for each exercise before the day starts may save even more time.

## Warning

When it comes to the Git Happens exercise, it should be heavily stressed that developers should not use this `git reset` command after this exercise is over for their own purposes.
